Compose a 5-second electronic orchestra music clip using a subset of the provided instruments. 
Your composition should integrate an audible melody, countermelody, and bassline, all following a recognizable chord progression. The music must incorporate variations in dynamics and demonstrate adherence to basic music theory principles. If a sequence of previously generated music is supplied, ensure musical continuity.
### Steps
1. **Chord Progression**: Based on the user prompt, generate a suitable chord progression. Use more major chords for a happy theme and more minor chords for a sad theme, while adhering to basic music theory rules.
2. **Compose Parts Simultaneously**:
   - **Bassline**: 
     - Lowest pitch, steady rhythm, sets harmonic groundwork.
     - Follows the chord progression.
   - **Melody**:
     - Main theme, highest pitch, most audible.
     - Significant rhythmic variation, should follow the chord progression but DO NOT mirror the bassline.
   - **Countermelody**:
     - Sits between the melody and bassline in pitch.
     - Complements the melody and shares inspiration, follows the bassline's chord progression.
   -**Drums**
     - Accompanies the previous three parts and helps set the tempo
     - Matches the mood of the piece - for example, louder drums with more cymbals for something exciting, or slower and softer for something somber
3. **Layering**: Ensure all three parts begin simultaneously and play concurrently for a duration of 5 seconds. Each part can have multiple notes, and not all parts have to play at every point in time.
### Output Format
Output your composition as JUST a list of [instrument, delay, duration, note, volume].

- **Instrument**: Any from the provided list, e.g., `piano`, `pluck`, etc. without the colon.
- **Delay**: Delay between current note and previous note in seconds.
- **Duration**: Length of note played in seconds.
- **Note**: Specify note, e.g., `C4`, `F6`, `Fs4`, `Bb2`. Sharp notes use the symbol s instead of the symbol #, and flat notes use the symbol b.
- **Volume**: Float between 0 and 0.5.

The total sum of all `delay` commands should approximate 5 seconds. Use `delay: 0` to play notes concurrently.

### Examples
- Example output:

[['piano', 0, 0.6, 'C4', 0.45], ['pluck', 0, 0.4, 'E4', 0.3], ['tri', 0, 0.5, 'G3', 0.25], ['piano', 0, 0.7, 'F4', 0.4], ['pluck', 0, 0.3, 'A4', 0.35], ['tri', 0, 0.4, 'C4', 0.2], ['piano', 0.5, 0.7, 'F4', 0.4], ['pluck', 0.5, 0.3, 'A4', 0.35], ['piano', 1, 0.6, 'C4', 0.45], ['pluck', 1, 0.4, 'E4', 0.3], ['tri', 1, 0.5, 'G3', 0.25]]

(Total sleep should equal about 5 seconds.) 
### Notes
- Ensure musical harmony and coherence while creatively engaging with the user's prompt.
- Validate that all chords, rhythms, and dynamics adhere to the intended mood and message of the music piece.
- Ensure that all parts start at the same time and play simultaneously.
- Ensure that transitions are not abrupt in tempo and timbre - if you decide to change musical instruments, do it gradually and in a way that the timbre change is fluid.

Your response should only be an array, with no words else outside of the array, and no markdown at all. It should be parseable by ast.literal.eval() without causing any errors.
